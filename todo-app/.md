# SLIs, SLOs, and SLA for todo-api

## 1. SLIs (Service Level Indicators)

SLIs are measurable indicators of your application's performance and reliability.

For the `todo-api`, we define the following SLIs:

### SLIs:

- **API Response Time**: Average response time for API requests (in seconds).  
  _Prometheus metric: `http_request_duration_seconds_bucket` (histogram)_

- **API Availability**: Percentage of time the API is up and responsive.  
  _Derived from `http_requests_total` (count of successful vs. failed requests)_

- **Event Loop Lag**: Average event loop lag in seconds.  
  _Prometheus metric: `nodejs_eventloop_lag_mean_seconds`_

- **Memory Usage**: Resident memory used by the process in bytes.  
  _Prometheus metric: `process_resident_memory_bytes`_

- **HTTP Error Rate**: Percentage of requests returning 5xx status codes.  
  _Prometheus metric: filtered `http_requests_total` with status code labels_

---

## 2. SLOs (Service Level Objectives)

SLOs are performance goals for the SLIs.

### SLOs:

- **API Response Time**: ≤ 300 ms for 95% of requests  
- **API Availability**: ≥ 99.9% monthly uptime  
- **Event Loop Lag**: ≤ 20 ms (0.02 seconds) on average  
- **Memory Usage**: ≤ 150 MB  
- **HTTP Error Rate**: ≤ 0.1% of total requests

## 3. SLA (Service Level Agreement)

The SLA communicates these objectives and expectations clearly to users.

**Service Level Agreement (SLA) for todo-api**

We are committed to providing a fast and reliable todo-api service. Under this SLA, we guarantee the following:

- API uptime of at least 99.9% per calendar month  
- API requests will have an average response time of ≤ 300ms in 95% of cases  
- Average event loop lag will not exceed 20ms  
- The service will consume no more than 150MB of resident memory  
- The rate of HTTP 5xx errors will remain below 0.1% of total requests

**In case of SLA violation:**

- Users will be notified within 24 hours  
- We will take all necessary steps to resolve the issue  
- In case of repeated SLA breaches, compensation may be considered

Thank you for using our service!
